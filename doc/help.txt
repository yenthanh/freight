Idea to get data:
1. In db, the MS_CONFIGURATION table will store the excel's name of each carrier
2. In db, the MS_EXCEL_CARRIER_ZONE_MATRIX table will store the sheet name which store the zone and matrix of each carrier
3. In db, the MS_EXCEL_RATE table will store the sheet name in the execel file that containce range of weight
We have some epecial case:
a. About zone
DHL : It has difference zone for import, export,3rd party zone. 
FexEx: Has only one zone and a matrix
b. About the range
DHL: All sheet has min/max value of weight
FexEx: with envelope type, dont have range min-max


Standard Excel
FedEx Ratecard 01 Jan 21 upload.xlsx / 
Maxtrix Zone: need to be follow the format
3rd Pty Zone:First column header change to: Country/Territory; change U.S.A to USA

The country name is not correct
